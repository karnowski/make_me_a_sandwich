General:
- Per abedra: have this thing scp & ssh itself onto the target server?
- how to have this "generated" into an app?
- monit?  god?  some sort of health-checking monitoring system?
- cleanup the use of the "deploy" user in the individual READMEs
- how to tie in the vmware stuff?  just remove it?

Centos:
- add the "checking" UI mileposts that I added to ubuntu
